### Hi there 👋 I'm Eduardo Betancourt and welcome to my github page!


❤️ I love working on projects that are purpose driven and have a social cause. That's why I co-founded [imvisible](http://www.im-visible.com/), a platform to visualize daily sexual harassment.
As a final project of my Data Science bootcamp I developed **splocked** 🚫 which allows you to read reviews of your favorite movies and shows without spoilers. 

Currently, I'm a bioengineering student at Tec de Monterrey who is passionate about track and field, the environment and business and will continue to code throughout my carreer.
